# simulChess
Chess variant where both players move at the same time.

# new rules

- Both players move one of their pieces at the same time.
- There is a countdown between moves, giving each player time to think about their next move.
- Piece movement remains unchanged.
- You still cannot castle through check.
- Along with checkmate, scoring a check against the opponent's king results in victory.
- If two pieces move onto the same square at once during a turn, they capture each other.
- If two pieces move through each other during a move, they capture each other and are both removed from the board. (i.e. two rooks moving along a File, two bishops moving along a diagonal.)
- If two pawns attempt to capture each other at the same time, they are both removed from the board.
- Pawns cannot move through each other via forward movement. If two pawns attempt to move onto the same square at once (DECIDE: nothing happens? one player gets priority?)
- If a piece moves off a square that the opponent's piece moves to, nothing happens, provided the pieces didn't move through each other. (i.e. A rook moves off A8 and a bishop moves onto it.)  
- If the king moves off a square that the opponent then attacks, nothing happens.
- Checks can be blocked by moving a piece to intercept an opponents attack.

# why

this idea came from a 'shower thought'.
